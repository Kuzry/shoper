          As we began rolling out Remix to https://www.shopify.com, we realized
          just how big that site is. When you take into account all of the
          routes and their internationalized URLs (i.e., /pricing, /en/pricing,
          /es/precios and many more)—the app had over 1300 routes! And because
          Remix does have a good solution for URL aliasing (yet!), many of the
          route entries were duplicates pointing to the same route module, and
          thus duplicating the module information (its path, its other module
          imports, etc.). This resulted in a manifest that was ~85Kb compressed,
          and ~10Mb uncompressed. On slower devices, this could have a
          noticeable impact on page load times for the device to decompress,
          parse, compile, and execute the JS module.
